**Welcome to my blog!** I'm Ian Melchor, and I'm here to share my journey and insights at the intersection of **AI**, **sales**, and **technology**.


## Why This Blog? ðŸ¤”

The world of **AI**, **sales**, and **technology** is evolving rapidly. My background in **economics**, experience in **mortgage sales**, and current role in **tech** put me in a unique position to observe and reflect on these changes.

Here, I'll be exploring topics like:

1. **AI and Machine Learning**: How these technologies are reshaping industries, particularly in sales and mortgage.
2. **Sales**: An age-old practice that's being reshaped by technology. What changes, what remains?
3. **Game Theory in Modern Tech**: Revisiting those college classes in light of current AI developments.
4. **Coding**: My ongoing journey from complete novice to... well, let's see where it goes.
5. **Personal Stories**: This is a blog after all.

## What to Expect ðŸ“š

This blog isn't about having all the answers. It's about **asking questions**, **sharing observations**, and **exploring ideas**. I'll draw from my experiences in **mortgage sales**, my current work with **Bonzo**, and my ongoing learning in **AI and technology**.

Expect a blend of practical insights, theoretical musings, and perhaps a few analogies drawn from my gaming background. I'm here to learn and share, and I invite you to join me in this exploration.

## An Open Invitation ðŸš€

Whether you're in **sales**, **tech**, or just curious about where these fields are heading, you're welcome here. Let's navigate this rapidly changing landscape together, **questioning**, **learning**, and **growing** as we go.

Thank you for being part of this journey.
